    "Recall that **long format:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Has potentially multiple \"id\" (identification) columns.\n",
    "- Has a single value column that is described by the id columns.\n",
    "- When converted from wide format, there is a \"variable\" column that is one of the id columns. This \"variable\" column corresponds to the multiple columns in your wide format you wanted converted into one \"variable\" id column and one \"value\" column.\n",
    "- Is a standard format in SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "And **wide format:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can have multiple ID _and_ value columns.\n",
    "- Trades off the simplicity of a single value column for a more compact matrix.\n",
    "- Is not useful in SQL because it is harder to join tables (more on this later).\n",
    "- Can be more useful in pandas because operations due to operations across columns.\n",
